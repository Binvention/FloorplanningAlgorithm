# FloorplanningAlgorithm
This is a basic floor planning algorithm that calculates the minimum area of a Normalized Polish Expression given data on the cells in the floorplan. Current capabilites include building a skewed slicing tree, calculating possible areas for the floorplan, and selecting the minimum area to describe the cost of the floorplan.
